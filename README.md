# Root Finder
This project illustrates some numerical analysis algorithms to find the root of a mathematical function. This project has been done as an exercise to implement root finder algorithms in the `Numerical Analysis & Algorithms` course in postgraduate studies at Cairo University.

This project depends on [Flask Dashboard Now UI](https://appseed.us/admin-dashboards/flask-dashboard-nowui-design)
Open-Source **admin dashboard** with **NowUI Design** coded in **Flask**.

## Project Installation

1. Clone the repo
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/Yousab/root-finder.git
  $ cd root-finder
  ```

2. Install the dependencies:
  ```
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Run the development server:
  ```
  $ python app.py
  ```

4. Navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Features

- SQLite database
- Login, Register
- Static Build `python ./static.py`. The static build goes to `app/build` directory 
- FTP Deploy script. **Info**: this `require node.js` and the edit of `deploy.js` to add FTP server credentials.
